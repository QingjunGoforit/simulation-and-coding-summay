```python
  n Python, len(), size, and shape are used to get information about the dimensions of data structures, but they are used in different contexts and with different types of objects.
  1. len()
  Usage: len() is a built-in function that returns the number of items in an object.
  Applicable To: Lists, strings, tuples, dictionaries, and other iterable objects.
  Example:
  Python
  my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
  print(len(my_list))  # Output: 4
  my_string = "hello"
  print(len(my_string))  # Output: 5

  2. size
  Usage: size is an attribute of NumPy arrays that returns the total number of elements in the array.
  Applicable To: NumPy arrays.
  Example:
  Python
  import numpy as np
  my_array = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
  print(my_array.size)  # Output: 6

  3. shape
  Usage: shape is an attribute of NumPy arrays and Pandas DataFrames that returns a tuple representing the dimensions of the array or DataFrame.
  Applicable To: NumPy arrays and Pandas DataFrames.
  Example:
  Python
  import numpy as np
  import pandas as pd
  # NumPy array example
  my_array = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
  print(my_array.shape)  # Output: (2, 3)
  # Pandas DataFrame example
  df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2], 'B': [3, 4]})
  print(df.shape)  # Output: (2, 2)
  
Summary
  len(): Use for general Python iterables to get the number of elements.
  size: Use for NumPy arrays to get the total number of elements.
  shape: Use for NumPy arrays and Pandas DataFrames to get the dimensions (rows, columns).
